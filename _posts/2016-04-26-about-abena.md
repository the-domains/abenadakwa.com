**Abena**, means "_girl born on Tuesday_" and yes, I was born on a Tuesday! But, not the last one. I have a **MBA in management and strategy** and I'm currently working on my **DBA, doctorate's in business administration**. I am a published author of a collection of poetry called, **[The Poems of Life][0].****​**

I discovered my love for the written word at the tender age of twelve. I had written my first collection of poetry well before I turned twenty-one. As a teen I found that there was no better way to express my emotions then to apply pen to paper and let the words flow. Writing has helped me develop both, emotionally and mentally. I encourage everyone to write because I believe that it is the best and most affordable form of therapy that anyone can participate in. I have also written a screenplay, a children's book, and have several works in progress. I love pasta, ice cream, the ocean and traveling.

**I invite you** to stop by my new website [**Seek Your Path**][1](click the link or copy and paste www.seekyourpath.com) _to join a community of freedom loving _**path seekers **whom are eagerly breaking away from the 9 to 5 nightmare **to create multiple streams of passive income**. 

If **you are ready to have**_more time_ to spend with loved ones, _travel_ the world, or just **relax **while making **more money**, **[Seek ][1][Your Path][1]** may be right for you. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/059ff357-89f2-41ab-8324-31dcfbce7f1f.jpg)
